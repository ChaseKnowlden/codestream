# CodeStream

CodeStream helps dev teams discuss, review, and understand code. Discussing code is now as simple as commenting on a Google Doc â€” select the code and type your question.

CodeStream turns conversation into documentation by capturing all of the discussion about your code, and saving it with your code. Each discussion is represented as a "codemark" that is permanently connected to the lines of code to which it refers.

# CodeStream for Visual Studio Code

### Getting the code

```
git clone https://github.com/TeamCodeStream/vscode-codestream.git
```

ðŸ‘‰ **NOTE!** Make sure to clone the `vscode-codestream` repository into a folder that is a sibling of the `codestream-component` and `codestream-lsp-agent` repositories

Prerequisites

- [Git](https://git-scm.com/)
- [NodeJS](https://nodejs.org/en/), `>= 8.9.1, < 9.0.0`
- [npm](https://npmjs.com/), `>= 6.2.0`

### Warnings

ðŸ‘‰ Do NOT make changes to the files in `src/shared` they are files copied in from `codestream-lsp-agent` and need to be modified there.

### Build

From a terminal, where you have cloned the repository, execute the following command to re-build the agent from scratch:

```
npm run rebuild
```

ðŸ‘‰ **NOTE!** This will run a complete rebuild of the extension, webview, and agent.

Or to just run a quick build, use:

```
npm run build
```

### Watch

During development you can use a watcher to make builds on changes quick and easy. From a terminal, where you have cloned the repository, execute the following command:

```
npm run watch
```

It will do an initial full build and then watch for file changes, compiling those changes incrementally, enabling a fast, iterative coding experience.

To watch the extension and agent, use the following in separate terminals:

```
npm run watch
npm run agent:watch
```

Or use the provided `watch` task in VS Code, execute the following from the command palette (be sure there is no `>` at the start):

```
task watch
```

ðŸ‘‰ **Tip!** If you only want to watch for changes in the webview you can execute the following command:

```
npm run webview:watch
```

ðŸ‘‰ **Tip!** Open VS Code to the folder where you have cloned the repository and press <kbd>CMD+SHIFT+B</kbd> (<kbd>CTRL+SHIFT+B</kbd> on Windows, Linux) to start the build. To view the build output open the Output stream by pressing <kbd>CMD+SHIFT+U</kbd>. This will run the `watch` task.

ðŸ‘‰ **Tip!** You don't need to stop and restart the development version of Code after each change. You can just execute `Reload Window` from the command palette. We like to assign the keyboard shortcut <kbd>CMD+R</kbd> (<kbd>CTRL+R</kbd> on Windows, Linux) to this command.

### Formatting

We use [prettier](https://prettier.io/) for formatting our code. You can run prettier across the code by calling `npm run pretty` from a terminal.

To format the code as you make changes you can install the [Prettier - Code formatter](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items/esbenp.prettier-vscode) extension.

### Linting

We use [tslint](https://palantir.github.io/tslint/) for linting our code. You can run tslint across the code by calling `npm run lint` from a terminal. Warnings from tslint show up in the `Errors and Warnings` quick box and you can navigate to them from inside VS Code.

To lint the code as you make changes you can install the [TSLint](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items/eg2.tslint) extension.

### Testing

To run the unit tests (currently only for the agent) run the following from a terminal:

```
npm run test
```

### Bundling

To generate a production bundle (without packaging) run the following from a terminal:

```
npm run bundle
```

To generate a VSIX (installation package) run the following from a terminal:

```
npm run bundle
npm run pack
```

### Configuration

#### Connecting to a CodeStream environment

To connect to the PD environment, use the following settings

```json
"codestream.serverUrl": "https://pd-api.codestream.us:9443",
"codestream.email": "<email>",
"codestream.password": "<password>",
"codestream.team": "<team>", // Shouldn't really be needed unless there are issues and you belong to more than 1 team
```

To connect to the Production environment, use the following settings

```json
"codestream.email": "<email>",
"codestream.password": "<password>",
"codestream.team": "<team>", // Shouldn't really be needed unless there are issues and you belong to more than 1 team
```
